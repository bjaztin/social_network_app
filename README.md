# social_network_app

Introducing the ‘HelloYou’ web application, a built-in social network app using the Django framework. It allows users to create an account, log in, and create a post that can be shared with others. Also, users can add other users as friends, accept or decline a friend request, and unfriend other users they no longer want to be connected with. Moreover, users can join forums with their preferred interests and interact and have group discussions with other users. Lastly, the ‘HelloYou’ application allows users to search for other connections by name, making it easier for them to find other users they want to connect with.

The file for the web application is submitted on a zip file. To unzip and run the Django web application. Follow these following instructions:
  
● Download the submitted ‘project’ zip file and save it to your chosen directory.
	
● Unzip the file then open the terminal or command shell script.
	
● To run the application, locate the directory file where the file is saved (let us assume the zip file is saved in the desktop folder) with the ‘cd’ command you can change the directories. In this case, the command will be ‘cd desktop/project’

● Activate the virtual environment of the project with the ‘source ./myvenv/bin/activate’ command.
	
● Make another directory by using this ‘cd helloYouProj’ command
	
● Afterward, use ‘python3 manage.py runserver’ command to start the Django development.
	
● Once the development server is running, you can open any web browser and go to ‘http://127.0.0.1:8000/’ for to access the web application. This will direct you to the registration page as the first page of the application.
	
● If you want to log in directly, you can key in these credentials: username: admin and password: password
